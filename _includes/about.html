                    <p>Sydney is a New Yorker. Upstate, downstate, east, west, all New York. She’s good at the cold, terrible at the heat, knows how to drive in vengeful traffic and ridiculous snow, has no idea what a Waffle House is, causes scenes when Montell Jordan comes on the stereo, brings home stray cats, keeps a lot of secrets, wins every game (because she refuses to play any she loses), will buy any farmer’s market pastry if it’s attracted a swarm of bees, fills up her time so she doesn’t have to deal with life issues, practices the philosophy of “It’s nice to be nice,” pretends to be confident when flooded with fear, offers compliments and thanks as often as possible, tries hard, very, very hard to make it in this world.</p>
                    <p>Sydney was born in an old house in a little town in the Catskill Mountains of New York. She earned her bachelor’s degree in writing from Plattsburgh State University and her master’s of science in publishing from Pace University and was the 2017 recipient of the Kathryn Gurfein Writing Fellowship from the Writing Institute at Sarah Lawrence College. She got her dream job working in publishing in 2008, and currently works as the content development director at the American Booksellers Association. She divides her time between New York City and Hudson, New York.</p>
